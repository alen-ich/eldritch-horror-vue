# Base-game Asset cards

The supplied archive contains exactly 40 individually named English Asset fronts, matching the base-game component count. No expansion cards were found.

`packages/content/src/assets.ts` provides stable IDs, printed English titles, values, normalized traits, timing categories, effect text, source-image references, and generated front/back URLs for the complete roster. Validation requires exactly 40 unique IDs and titles, legal values and categories, nonempty effect text, and matching source and browser image names. Investigator records now cross-reference all ten printed starting Assets by stable ID while retaining the original setup text for non-Asset possessions.

The supplied JSON is retained as source data under `source-assets/assets`, and `pnpm assets:data` deterministically generates the normalized TypeScript definitions. The complete shared Asset back is supplied, generated, and required by content validation.

The Asset family remains `needs_review` rather than `verified` because:

- the transcribed effects still need comprehensive card-by-card scan verification;
- most Asset effects still depend on unimplemented tests, combat, encounters, Conditions, Spells, Clues, Monsters, or component actions.

## Engine coverage

The authoritative engine now removes starting Assets from the deck, grants them by stable ID, shuffles the remaining deck privately, and exposes a four-card Reserve. Acquire Assets uses the generic Influence-test lifecycle, including improvements, supported bonuses, and sequential Clue rerolls; it then validates selected cards against total successes, refills the Reserve, and supports the optional one-card discard after buying nothing. Active tests and owner-only choices survive serialization and reconnection. Bank Loan is intentionally unavailable until Debt Conditions are implemented.

Four cards have explicit typed effect nodes and executable tests:

- Personal Assistant adds one die to Influence tests, including Acquire Assets. Its optional reroll remains pending the general test/reroll system.
- Fine Clothes makes each 6 count as two successes during Acquire Assets.
- King James Bible recovers one additional Sanity during Rest. Its combat reroll remains pending combat tests.
- Private Care immediately restores Health and Sanity to maximum, then enters the Asset discard pile.

The engine never parses `effectText`. Cards without typed nodes remain display-only until their prerequisites and verified handlers are present.

Run `pnpm assets:generate` to reproduce the 40 WebP fronts and shared back under `apps/web/public/cards/assets` from the committed sources.
